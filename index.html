      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        T’Cha is a creative education and technology initiative designed for curious kids and the communities that raise them. 
        It’s built for learners who ask big questions, love to explore, and may not always have access to books, tablets, or personalized learning at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're a 2nd grader dreaming about stars, a 5th grader who loves sketching comics, or a caregiver looking for ways to nurture your child's spark—
        T’Cha offers printable discovery journals and creative quests that help children learn, reflect, and grow on their own terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name “T’Cha” comes from the isiXhosa word for teacher (*titshala*), and our mission is simple: 
        help kids feel seen, supported, and inspired—wherever they are, with whatever they have.
